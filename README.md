##  MIPS32 Assembler and Disassembler implemented using Python ##

The implementation of the MIPS assembler and Disassembler is done in two different python codes.

These Assembler and Disassembler work only for the set of instructions present in the attached data card. 

The input file specifications: A text file(.txt) should be given as the input file. If both the text and .py files are in the same folder then it is enough to enter the name of the text file but if both are in different folders then the address of the text file should be mentioned. Placing the files in the same folder is preferred.

Input limitations:
1.  The labels in the input of the assembler should not contain any comma (",") and colon(":").
2.  The offset, addresses, and immediate values present in the code should be in decimal format.
